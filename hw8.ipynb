Looking at the index number, we can see that from 0-51 each measurement is 7 days after the previous measurement, which corresponds to 52 weeks in a year. However in 2018, it seems like the measurements were taken every week starting from 2018-01-07 until 2018-03-25, a total of 12 weeks instead of 52 weeks, which may suggest that the data collection finished early.

This is an overlapping region because San Diego, San Francisco, and Sacramento are all contained within California. Therefore, unlike the In the Rain in Australia dataset, where each location was a different place in Australia, this does not seem to be the case in our avocados dataset.

Previously we used `DummyClassifier` or `DummyRegressor` as a baseline. This time, we'll do something else as a baseline: we'll assume the price stays the same from this week to next week. So, we'll set our prediction of \"AveragePriceNextWeek\" exactly equal to \"AveragePrice\", assuming no change. That is kind of like saying, \"If it's raining today then I'm guessing it will be raining tomorrow\". This simplistic approach will not get a great score but it's a good starting point for reference.

This goes beyond the benchmark set at 0.79 which may suggest that the model improved significantly in predicting avocado prices with the encoding of month as well as introduction of lag features. However, on the other side, it may mean that our model is also overfitting."

    "1.) An example of a real world situation where the time series data would have unequally spaced time points could be customer support tickets. The reason why this would be unequally spaced is because customers are not issuing support tickets at fixed intervals, they will issue support tickets when they have a problem, which is typically irregular/sporadic. This could lead to gaps in between the data during the day, even worse, we may not get any support tickets issued one day, and 100 support tickets issued another. Therefore we can see how this would lead to unequally spaced time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Creating lagged versions of features would struggle with unequally spaced time points, this is because when we use lagged features, we typically want the intervals of observations to be of equal distance. However, if we have unequally spaced time points, each interval of observation will be different from each other, making it hard for the model to pick up on patterns as well as the temporal relationship between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) The problem with using time of day as a numeric feature is that the ridge model will not be able to capture the periodic pattern, this is because a linear function can only learn a linear function of the time of day. A linear function would not be able to pick up a periodic function of the time of day. In order to tackle this problem we encoded the feature as a categorical variable instead through OneHotEncoder."

Assuming that we have 10 features and model a four-class classification problem using sklearn's LogisticRegression, it will learn a coefficient for each feature and each class, as well as an intercept for each class. Thus, we will have 10 coefficients for each feature for each class, and 4 intercepts as we learn an intercept for each class. The final number of parameters will be 10 coefficients x 4 classes + 4 intercepts = 44. We will learn 44 parameters.\n",

    "2.) The reason that multiple sequential transformations of data is so useful when it comes to transfer learning is that with pre-trained models they typically have a lot of useful features in the lower layers so that instead of having to re-train the model from scratch, we can just fine-tune the outer layers, which allow us to efficiently adapt the model and tailor it to our tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) I would use a pre-trained Convolutional neural networks (CNN), this is because as stated above, the pre-trained models have learned many useful features in their lower layers due to the exposure to large datasets. Thus, we can fine-tune the outer layers to our specific task."

    "1.) The problem with simply labeling customers as \"churned\" or \"not churned\" and using standard supervised learning techniques is that when we do that, we are predicting based on when the data was collected. However, it would make more sense to find out how long before a customer \"churns\" to help incentivize them to stay, whether that is offering promotions or discounts. Thus, instead of simply labeling customers as \"churned\" or \"not churned\", we should instead be interested in discovering the time until the customer churns. Additionally, this leads to something called right-censoring; this is because customers who have \"not churned\", might \"churn\" shortly, meaning we do not have access to the entire customer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) There is not enough information to answer; this is because customer A, who joined last week, may churn early if they discover that the subscription service does not provide enough value or does not fit their needs. Customer B, who has been with the service for a year, has found that the subscription service has fulfilled its value and is no longer necessary to continue, and thus churning shortly after a year. Therefore, without more information, we are unlikely to be able to predict who leaves the service first as both customers have different reasons to leave or stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) If a customer's survival function is almost flat during a certain period, that means that there is a very low risk that the customer \"churns\". This suggests that during this period, the likelihood of the event occurring is stable and unchanged, meaning that the customer is most likely not going to \"churn\"."
